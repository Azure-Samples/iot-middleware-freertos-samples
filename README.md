## Getting Started with Azure IoT middleware for FreeRTOS

The Azure IoT middleware for FreeRTOS simplifies the connection of devices running FreeRTOS to the Azure IoT services. It implements a modular approach that brings flexibility to IoT developers by allowing them to bring their own network stack (MQTT, TLS and Socket).

The [Azure IoT middleware for FreeRTOS repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-middleware-freertos) has the core functionalities of the middleware and no external dependencies, however to implement the working samples, we need to bring a network stack which is the objective of the samples in this repo. 

We have two sets of samples:

- **Azure IoT Central**: These samples leverage Azure IoT Central, Azure DPS (Device Provisioning Service) and, Plug and Play. Azure subscription is not required during the initial 7 days of the [IoT Central Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/iot-central/#pricing).
- **Azure IoT Hub**: These samples leverage Azure IoT Hub, DPS (Device Provisioning) and Plug and Play.

### IoT Central Samples

Below you will find samples for development kits showing how to use the Azure IoT middleware for FreeRTOS connected to Azure IoT Central. The following samples support these development kits:

- ESPRESSIF:
  - [ESP32-Azure IoT Kit](demos/projects/ESPRESSIF/aziotkit/GSG.md)

- STMicroelectronics:
  - [B-L475E-IOT01A](demos/projects/ST/b-l475e-iot01a/GSG.md)

### IoT Hub Samples:

Below you will find samples for development kits and simulators showing how to use the Azure IoT middleware for FreeRTOS connected to Azure IoT hub. The following samples support these development kits:

- ESPRESSIF:
  - [ESP32](demos/projects/ESPRESSIF/esp32/)
  - [ESP32 Azure IoT Kit](demos/projects/ESPRESSIF/aziotkit/)

- NXP:
  - [MIMXRT1060-EVK](demos/projects/NXP/mimxrt1060/)

- STMicroelectronics:
  - [B-L475E-IOT01A](demos/projects/ST/b-l475e-iot01a/)
  - [B-L4S5I-IOT01A](demos/projects/ST/b-l4s5i-iot01a/)
  - [STM32H745I-DISCO](demos/projects/ST/stm32h745i-disco/cm7)

### Plug and Play Sample

The easiest way to interact with the Plug and Play sample from the IoT service side is to use Azure IoT Explorer.  To interact with the device sample:

- Install [Azure IoT Explorer](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-explorer/#plug-and-play).
- Download [the Thermostat model](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/blob/master/DTDL/v2/samples/Thermostat.json) to a local directory.
- Start Azure IoT Explorer and then:
  - [Configure your hub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-explorer/#configure-an-iot-hub-connection).  Once you've created your thermostat device, you should see it listed in the UX.
  - Go to `IoT Plug and Play Settings` on the home screen, select `Local Folder` for the location of the model definitions, and point to the folder you downloaded the thermostat model.
  - Go to the devices list and select your thermostat device.  Now select `IoT Plug and Play components` and then `Default Component`.
  - You will now be able to interact with the Plug and Play device.

Additional instructions for using Azure IoT Explorer are available [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-explorer/#plug-and-play).
