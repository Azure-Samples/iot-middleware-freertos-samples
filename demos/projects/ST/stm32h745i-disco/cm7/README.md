# Connect a STMicroelectronics STM32H745I-DISCO Discovery kit using Azure IoT middleware for FreeRTOS

## What you need

- ST Microelectronics DevKit: [STM32H745I](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32h745i-disco.html)
- Ethernet Cable
- Micro USB male cable

## Prerequisites

- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) (Version 3.13 or higher)
- [Ninja build system](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases) (Version 1.10 or higher)
- [GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads) (Version 9 or higher)
- Serial terminal tool like [Termite](https://www.compuphase.com/software_termite.htm), Putty, Tera Term, etc.

To run this sample you can use a device previously created on your Azure IoT Hub or you may have the Azure IoT middleware for FreeRTOS provision your device automatically using Azure Device Provisioning Services (DPS).

IoT Hub | DPS 
---------|----------
Have an [Azure IoT Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-create-through-portal) created | Have an instance of [IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-dps/quick-setup-auto-provision#create-a-new-iot-hub-device-provisioning-service)
Have a [logical device](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-create-through-portal#register-a-new-device-in-the-iot-hub) created in your Azure IoT Hub using your preferred authentication method* | Have an [individual enrollment](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-dps/how-to-manage-enrollments#create-a-device-enrollment) created in your instance of DPS using your preferred authentication method*

*While this sample supports SAS keys and Certificates, this guide will refer only to SAS keys. 

### Install prerequisites on Windows

Ensure that cmake, ninja and the ARM toolset binaries are available in the `PATH` environment variable.

You may also need to enable long path support for both Windows and git:

- Windows: <https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation?tabs=cmd#enable-long-paths-in-windows-10-version-1607-and-later>
- Git: As **administrator** run

  ```powershell
  git config --system core.longpaths true
  ```

## Get the middleware

Clone the following repo to download all sample device code, setup scripts, and offline versions of the documentation. 

*If you previously cloned this repo in another sample, you don't need to do it again.*

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/iot-middleware-freertos-samples.git
```

To initialize the repo, run the following command:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Prepare the device

To connect the STM DevKit to Azure, you'll modify a configuration file for Wi-Fi and Azure IoT settings, rebuild the image, and flash the image to the device.

Update the file `iot-middleware-freertos-samples/demos/projects/ST/stm32h745i-disco/cm7/config/demo_config.h` with your configuration values.

If you're using a device previously created in your **IoT Hub** with SAS authentication, disable DPS by commenting out `#define democonfigENABLE_DPS_SAMPLE` and setting the following parameters:

Parameter | Value 
---------|----------
 `democonfigDEVICE_ID` | _{Your Device ID value}_
 `democonfigHOSTNAME` | _{Your Azure IoT Hub Host name value}_
 `democonfigDEVICE_SYMMETRIC_KEY` | _{Your Primary Key value}_

If you're using **DPS** with an individual enrollment with SAS authentication, set the following parameters:

Parameter | Value 
---------|----------
 `democonfigID_SCOPE` | _{Your DPS ID scope value}_
 `democonfigREGISTRATION_ID` | _{Your Device Registration ID value}_
 `democonfigDEVICE_SYMMETRIC_KEY` | _{Your Primary Key value}_

## Build the image

To build the device image, navigate to the `iot-middleware-freertos-samples` directory and run the following commands:

  ```bash
    cmake -G Ninja -DVENDOR=ST -DBOARD=stm32h745i-disco -Bstm32h745i-disco .
    cmake --build stm32h745i-disco
  ```

After the build completes, confirm that a folder named `stm32h745i-disco/` was created and it contains a file named `demo/projects/ST/stm32h745i-disco/iot-middleware-sample.bin`. 

## Flash the image

1. Connect the Micro USB cable to the USB STLINK port on the STM DevKit, and then connect it to your computer.

2. In File Explorer, find the binary file that you created in the previous section and copy it.

3. In File Explorer, find the STM Devkit that's connected to your computer. The device appears as a drive on your system with the drive label `DIS_H745XI`.

4. Paste the binary file into the root folder of the STM Devkit. Flashing starts automatically and completes in a few seconds.

5. Connect an Ethernet cable to your STM DevKit and your network equipment.

## Confirm device connection details

You can use one of the terminal applications to monitor communication and confirm that your device is set up correctly. Go to Device Manager in Windows to determine which COM port your device was assigned.

The following settings can be used to monitor serial data:

- Baud Rate: `115200`
- Data Bits: `8`
- Stop Bits: `1`
- Parity: none
- Flow Control: none

## Size Chart

The following chart shows the RAM and ROM usage for the STM32H745I-DISCO Discovery kit from ST Microelectronics.
Build options: CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizeRel (-Os) and no logging (-DLIBRARY_LOG_LEVEL=LOG_NONE):
This sample can includes either IoT Hub only or both IoT Hub and DPS services. The table below shows RAM/ROM sizes considering:

- Middleware libraries only – represents the libraries for Azure IoT connection.
- Total size – which includes the Azure IoT middleware for FreeRTOS, Mbed TLS, FreeRTOS, CoreMQTT and the HAL for the dev kit.

|  | Middleware library size | | Total Size | |
|---------|----------|---------|---------|---------
|**Sample** | **Flash (text,rodata,data)** | **RAM1,RAM2(dss,data)** | **Flash (text,rodata,data)** | **RAM1,RAM2(dss,data)** |
| IoT Hub + DPS | 23.96 KB | 12 bytes | 281.53 KB | 378.90 KB
| IoT Hub only | 11.61 KB | 12 bytes | 275.56 KB | 378.80 KB
