> * `ID scope`
> * `Device ID`
> * `Primary key`

## Prepare the device

To connect the STM DevKit to Azure, you'll modify a configuration file for Wi-Fi and Azure IoT settings, rebuild the image, and flash the image to the device.

### Add configuration

1. Open the following file in a text editor:

    > *iot-middleware-freertos-samples/demos/projects/ST/b-l475e-iot01a/config/demo_config.h*

1. Set the Wi-Fi constants to the following values from your local environment.
    |Constant name|Value|
    |-------------|-----|
    |`WIFI_SSID` |{*Your Wi-Fi ssid*}|
    |`WIFI_PASSWORD` |{*Your Wi-Fi password*}|
    |`WIFI_SECURITY_TYPE` |{*One of the enumerated Wi-Fi mode values in the file*}|

1. Set the Azure IoT device information constants to the values that you saved after you created Azure resources.

    |Constant name|Value|
    |-------------|-----|
    |`democonfigID_SCOPE` |{*Your ID scope value*}|
    |`democonfigREGISTRATION_ID` |{*Your Device ID value*}|
    |`democonfigDEVICE_SYMMETRIC_KEY` |{*Your Primary key value*}|

1. Save and close the file.

### Build the image

In your console, run the following commands from the *iot-middleware-freertos-samples* directory to build the device image:

```bash
cmake -G Ninja -DVENDOR=ST -DBOARD=b-l475e-iot01a -Bb-l475e-iot01a .
cmake --build b-l475e-iot01a
```

After the build completes, confirm that the binary file was created in the following path:

> *iot-middleware-freertos-samples\b-l475e-iot01a\demos\projects\ST\b-l475e-iot01a\iot-middleware-sample-gsg.bin*

### Flash the image

1. On the STM DevKit, locate the **Reset** button, the Micro USB port which is labeled **USB STLink**, and the board part number. You will refer to these items in the next steps. All of them are highlighted in the following picture:

    ![STM DevKit reset button and micro USB port](media/stm-devkit-board.png)

1. Connect the Micro USB cable to the **USB STLINK** port on the STM DevKit, and then connect it to your computer.
    > Note: For detailed setup information about the STM DevKit, see the instructions on the packaging, or see [B-L475E-IOT01A Resources](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/b-l475e-iot01a.html#resource) / [B-L4S5I-IOT01A Resources](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/b-l4s5i-iot01a.html#resource).

1. In File Explorer, find the binary files that you created in the previous section.

1. Copy the binary file whose file name corresponds to the part number of the STM Devkit you are using. For example, if your board part number is **B-L475E-IOT01A1**, copy the binary file named *iot-middleware-sample-gsg.bin*.

1. In File Explorer, find the STM Devkit that's connected to your computer. The device appears as a drive on your system with the drive label **DIS_L4IOT**.

1. Paste the binary file into the root folder of the STM Devkit. Flashing starts automatically and completes in a few seconds.

    > Note: During the flashing process, a LED toggles between red and green on the STM DevKit.

### Confirm device connection details

You can use the **Termite** utility to monitor communication and confirm that your device is set up correctly.

> **Note:** If you are unable to connect Termite to your devkit, install the [ST-LINK driver](https://my.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/software/driver/files/stsw-link009.zip) and try again.

1. Start **Termite**.
1. Select **Settings**.
1. In the **Serial port settings** dialog, check the following settings and update if needed:
    * **Baud rate**: 115,200
    * **Port**: The port that your STM DevKit is connected to. If there are multiple port options in the dropdown, you can find the correct port to use. Open Windows **Device Manager**, and view **Ports** to identify which port to use.
